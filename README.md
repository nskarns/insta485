This was an Instagram clone An Instagram clone implemented with client-side dynamic pages. First created a static site generator, then a server-side dynamic page, and finally created the client-side dynamic page. 

Through the development of the client-side dynamic page, the user could interact with the Instagram clone while not having to have to page reload upon certain action, such as liking a post, commenting, following someone, and more.

To complete the project to its full, my team and I developed many client-side dynamic pages, used JavaScript programming to update the page live upon a completed action, asynchronous programming (AJAX) to send information to a server and update the page locally at the same time, and used REST APIs to ensure proper communication happened between the user and the server.

The code for this project isn't available due to Honor Code policies, however a video of my team's project is in this Github repository.
